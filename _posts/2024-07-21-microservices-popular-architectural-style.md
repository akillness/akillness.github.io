## Microservices are a popular architectural style for building applications as a collection of small, independent services. 

Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with other services through APIs. 

This approach can help to improve the scalability, maintainability, and resilience of applications.

The infographic includes the following components:

### • 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀:  
A variety of databases are listed, including SQL databases (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (such as DynamoDB and Cassandra). The type of database you choose will depend on the specific needs of your application.
 
### • 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: 
There are a number of tools available for monitoring the health and performance of your microservices. Some of the tools listed in the infographic include Prometheus, Grafana, and Kibana.
 
### • 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: 
Message brokers are used to asynchronously send messages between microservices. Some of the message brokers listed in the infographic include Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Amazon SQS.
 
### • 𝗖𝗜/𝗖𝗗: 
CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) is a practice that helps to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying microservices. Some of the CI/CD tools listed in the infographic include Jenkins, GitLab Actions, and CircleCI.
 
### • 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀: 
A variety of programming languages can be used to develop microservices. Some of the languages listed in the infographic include Java, Node.js, Python, and Go.
 
### • 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀: 
Microservices can be deployed on a variety of cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.
 
### • 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: 
Security is a critical consideration when designing a microservices architecture. Some of the security considerations listed in the infographic include API authorization and TLS encryption.
 
### • 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
Container orchestration tools help to manage the deployment and scaling of containerized microservices. Some of the container orchestration tools listed in the infographic include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and OpenShift.

I hope this infographic is helpful!
