## Introduction

*Curiosity:* What happens when we combine the storytelling power of LLMs with interactive game worlds? How can AI transform NPCs from scripted entities into dynamic characters that adapt to player choices?

This course answers these questions by retrieving insights from cutting-edge AI research and game design principles, then innovating on how we build game experiences.

In this course, you will:

- 🤖 Learn to use powerful chat models to build intelligent NPC.
  - *Retrieve:* Understanding how LLMs can generate contextual dialogue and behavior
  - *Innovate:* Creating NPCs that feel alive and responsive
- 🪄 Run these powerful AI models locally or with cloud APIs.
  - *Curiosity:* What's the trade-off between local control and cloud scalability?
  - *Retrieve:* Exploring deployment strategies and their implications
- 🎨 Use AI tools to accelerate your game development: generate voices with text-to-speech models using image generation tools…
  - *Innovate:* Building entire content pipelines powered by AI
- 🎮 Work on exciting game demos.
  - *Retrieve:* Learning from real-world implementations and case studies
- 👩‍🎨 Build Your Own Game Demo.
  - *Innovation:* Turning curiosity into a playable prototype
