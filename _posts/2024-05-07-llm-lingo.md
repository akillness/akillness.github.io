# LLM Lingo: Must-Know Terms

LLM(Large Language Model) 공부하기 계획부터 실제 코드까지 작성하는 포스트를 작성한다. 당근에서 LLM 사용하기 


| LLM Lingo Type             | Description          |  |
| :--------------------------| :--------------- | :------  |
| `Foundation Model` | LLM designed to generate and understand human-like text across a wide range of use-cases | | 
| `Transformer` | A popular LLM design known for its attention mechanism and parallel processing abilities | |
| `Prompting` | Providing carefully crafted inputs to an LLM to generate desired outputs | |
| `Context-Length` | Maximum number of input words/tokens an LLM can consider when generating an output | |
| `Few-Shot Learning` | Providing very few examples to an LLM to assist it in performing a specific task. | |
| `Zero-Shot Learning` | Providing only task instructions to the LLM relying solely on its preexisting knowledge | |
| `RAG` | Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Appending retrieved information to improve LLM response | |
| `Knowledge Base(KB)` | Collection of documents from which relevant information is retrieved in RAG | |
| `Vector Database` | Stores vector representations of the KB, aiding the retrieval of relevant information in RAG, | |
| `Fine-Tuning` | Adapting an LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on task-specific data. | |
| `Instruction Tuning` | Adjusting an LLM's behavior during fine-tuning by providing specific guidelines/directives | |
| `Hallucination` | Tendency of LLMs to sometimes generate incorrect or non-factual information. | |
