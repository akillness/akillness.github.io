# LLM Lingo: Must-Know Terms ( Created By: [Aishwarya Naresh Reganti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areganti/recent-activity/all/) )

## Part 1 : Baseline

| LLM Lingo Type             | Description          |  |
| :--------------------------| :--------------- | :------  |
| `Foundation Model` | LLM designed to generate and understand human-like text across a wide range of use-cases | | 
| `Transformer` | A popular LLM design known for its attention mechanism and parallel processing abilities | |
| `Prompting` | Providing carefully crafted inputs to an LLM to generate desired outputs | |
| `Context-Length` | Maximum number of input words/tokens an LLM can consider when generating an output | |
| `Few-Shot Learning` | Providing very few examples to an LLM to assist it in performing a specific task. | |
| `Zero-Shot Learning` | Providing only task instructions to the LLM relying solely on its preexisting knowledge | |
| `RAG` | Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Appending retrieved information to improve LLM response | |
| `Knowledge Base(KB)` | Collection of documents from which relevant information is retrieved in RAG | |
| `Vector Database` | Stores vector representations of the KB, aiding the retrieval of relevant information in RAG, | |
| `Fine-Tuning` | Adapting an LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on task-specific data. | |
| `Instruction Tuning` | Adjusting an LLM's behavior during fine-tuning by providing specific guidelines/directives | |
| `Hallucination` | Tendency of LLMs to sometimes generate incorrect or non-factual information. | |

## Part 2 : Fine Tuning Edition

*Curiosity:* What insights can we retrieve from this? How does this connect to innovation in the field?

| LLM Lingo Type             | Description          |  |
| :--------------------------| :--------------- | :------  |
| `In-Context Learning` | Integrating task examples into prompts, enabling LLMs to handle new tasks without fine-tuning. | | 
| `SFT` | Supervised Fine-Tuning. Updating a pre-trained LLM with labeled data to perform a specific task. | |
| `Contrastive Learning` | Fine-tuning method that improves LLM by teaching it to discern data similarity and differences. | |
| `Transfer Learning` | Applying pre-trained knowledge from large datasets to improve LLM performance on smaller, task specific data. | |
| `Reward Modeling ` | Designing objectives to reward LLM outputs during the reinforcement learning process. | |
| `Reinforcement Learning` | Training LLMs through trial and error, with rewards/penalties based on its generated outputs. | |
| `RLHF` | Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. Human feedback is used as reward/penalty for LLM. | |
| `PEFT` | Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning updates only few parameters of LLMs and is hence both compute and cost efficient. | |
| `Quantization` | Reducing the precision of LLM parameters to save computational resources without sacrificing performance. | |
| `Pruning` | Trimming surplus connections or parameters to make LLMs smaller and faster yet performant. | |
| `LoRA` | Low-Rank Adaption is a PEFT method that inserts a smaller set of new weights to the LLM & trains only those. | |
| `Freeze Tuning` | Fine-tune with most of the LLM's weights frozen, except for some layers, generally, the task specific layers | |

### 🤔 What is Multi-Token Prediction Training?
- 💡Multi-token prediction is a training approach for LLMs like GPT and Llama, which typically use a next-token prediction loss during training.
- 💡Instead of predicting only the next token in a sequence, multi-token prediction involves training the language model to predict multiple future tokens simultaneously. 
- 💡Specifically, at each position in the training data, the model is tasked with predicting the next n tokens using n independent output heads, which operate on top of a shared model trunk. 
- 💡This method aims to improve sample efficiency by providing the model with more context and allowing it to anticipate multiple tokens ahead.

### 📖 Some more insights:

- ⛳ The proposed architecture involves a shared transformer trunk for producing a latent representation of the context, followed by independent output heads for predicting future tokens. This allows for the computation of the cross-entropy loss for multi-token prediction.
- ⛳ A challenge in training multi-token predictors is reducing GPU memory utilization. The paper proposes a memory-efficient implementation by carefully managing the forward and backward operations, significantly reducing peak 
- ⛳ The authors note that multi-token prediction leads to higher sample efficiency, enabling models to solve more problems with the same computational budget. Models trained with multi-token prediction achieve faster inference times, especially with self-speculative decoding methods.
- ⛳ Multi-token prediction promotes learning longer-term patterns, which is particularly beneficial for tasks like byte-level tokenization.
- ⛳ Performance gains of this method are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. The 13B parameter models solve 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. 
- ⛳ Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. 
- ⛳ As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3× faster at inference, even with large batch sizes.
