## ðŸ¤– If you're looking to build agentic genai applications, these design patterns will give you a great framework to start with!

Agentic AI is evolving fast, opening up many possibilities for a new paradigm of applications. 

When developing your agentic application, it's important to choose the right agent design patterns. 

With so many open-source tools and research available, it can feel overwhelming. To help, I've created a simple infographic that summarizes these design patterns:

- â›³ Reflection: The LLM reviews its own work to identify ways to improve.
  - Article : <https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-2-reflection/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io>
- â›³ Tool Use: The LLM is equipped with tools like web search, code execution, or other functions to help it gather information, take action, or process data.
  - Article : <https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-3-tool-use/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io>
- â›³ Planning: The LLM devises and follows a multistep plan to achieve a goal. For example, it might outline an essay, conduct online research, and then write a draft.

- â›³ Multi-agent Collaboration: Multiple AI agents work together, dividing tasks and discussing ideas to arrive at better solutions than a single agent could achieve alone.
