I think we've built something special with Paul Iusztin and Alex Vesa, focused on best engineering practices, reproducible pipelines, and end-to-end deployment. 

Basically everything that is currently lacking in the ecosystem.

Our goal is simple: to provide everything you need to know to build LLM applications, all in one book.

Kudos to Paul and Alex for the extra smooth collaboration! These guys have created the excellent LLM Twin Course on GitHub (https://lnkd.in/e-654u8S), an amazing resource for learning about LLMOps.

Everything I do online is free, but if you want to support this work, please pre-order our book. It greatly helps our visibility on Amazon.
