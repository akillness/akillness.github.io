| **Vector Databases** | Embedding storage and retrieval | ⭐⭐ High |
| **LLMOps** | MLOps for LLM applications | ⭐⭐ High |

### Why This Book Matters

*Retrieve:* The LLM ecosystem currently lacks comprehensive engineering guidance. This book fills that gap by providing:

1. **Practical Examples**: Real-world implementations
2. **Best Practices**: Industry-proven patterns
3. **Complete Workflows**: From development to deployment
4. **Production Focus**: Scalable, maintainable systems

*Innovate:* By following the practices in this handbook, you can build LLM applications that are:
- Reliable and maintainable
- Scalable and efficient
- Production-ready from day one

### Pre-order Information

📙 **Pre-order on Amazon**: <https://www.amazon.com/dp/1836200072>

**Note**: Everything online is free, but pre-ordering helps support the work and increases visibility on Amazon.

### Key Takeaways

*Retrieve:* This handbook provides comprehensive guidance on building production-ready LLM applications, covering everything from development practices to deployment strategies.

*Innovate:* Apply these engineering practices to create reliable, scalable LLM systems that can handle real-world production workloads.

*Curiosity → Retrieve → Innovation:* Start with curiosity about production LLM systems, retrieve knowledge from this handbook, and innovate by building robust applications that solve real problems.
