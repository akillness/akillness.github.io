![ Top 4 UDP Use Cases ](/assets/img/blog/top-4-udp-use-case.gif){: .light .shadow .rounded-10 w='1212' h='668' }


# UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is used in various software architectures for its simplicity, speed, and low overhead compared to other protocols like TCP.

### 🔹𝗟𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴
Many VoIP and video conferencing applications leverage UDP due to its lower overhead and ability to tolerate packet loss. Real-time communication benefits from UDP's reduced latency compared to TCP.

### 🔹 𝗗𝗡𝗦
DNS (Domain Name Service) queries typically use UDP for their fast and lightweight nature. Although DNS can also use TCP for large responses or zone transfers, most queries are handled via UDP.

### 🔹 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁
In low-latency trading, UDP is utilized for efficient market data delivery to multiple recipients simultaneously.

### 🔹 𝗜𝗼𝗧
UDP is often used in IoT devices for communications, sending small packets of data between devices.
