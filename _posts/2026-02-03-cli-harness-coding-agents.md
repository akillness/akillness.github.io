## 🤔 Curiosity: Why does the CLI keep winning?

As coding agents handle longer‑horizon tasks, the *terminal* keeps emerging as the best harness to **run, control, and scale** them. The CLI is the place where code, shell, git, and automation already live—and that native proximity changes everything.

This post consolidates the linked tools and highlights what each CLI gets right.

## 📚 Retrieve: What each CLI agent actually ships

### 🥇 Gemini CLI (Google)
- Open‑source CLI agent with a **free tier (60 req/min, 1,000 req/day)**
- Gemini 3 models with **1M‑token context**
- Built‑in tools: search grounding, file ops, shell commands, web fetching
- Extensible via MCP servers
- Install via npx/npm/brew

Repo: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli

### 🥈 OpenCode (Anomaly)
- **Provider‑agnostic** open‑source coding agent
- TUI‑first UX, client/server architecture, built by terminal‑first teams
- Built‑in agents (build/plan), optional subagent for deep search
- Cross‑platform installers + desktop app

Repo: https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode

### 🥉 Claude Code (Anthropic)
- Terminal‑native agent that understands your codebase and git workflow
- Works in terminal/IDE and can be tagged on GitHub
- Plugins system for extended commands and agents

### Copilot CLI (Microsoft / GitHub)
- Terminal harness connected to **repos, issues, PRs**
- MCP‑powered extensibility + explicit approval for actions
- Requires Copilot subscription

Repo: https://github.com/github/copilot-cli

### Kimi CLI (Moonshot)
- Terminal agent with built‑in shell mode (Ctrl‑X)
- MCP support + ACP IDE integration
- Zsh plugin + VS Code extension

Repo: https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli

### Mistral Vibe (Mistral)
- Minimal CLI coding assistant
- Built‑in agents, tool approvals, subagents
- Highly configurable; UNIX‑first support

Repo: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe

## 💡 Innovation: How I’d choose a CLI agent for real production

### 1) **When I need maximum model context**
Gemini CLI is the clear winner if I want **long‑context reasoning** and can stay inside Google’s ecosystem.

### 2) **When I need provider freedom**
OpenCode and Qwen Code keep the **model layer flexible**, which matters if I’m iterating on cost/latency trade‑offs.

### 3) **When I need GitHub‑native workflows**
Copilot CLI’s tight integration with issues/PRs is the strongest if the repo lives on GitHub and governance matters.

### 4) **When I need a minimal but safe terminal agent**
Mistral Vibe’s **approval flow + subagents** is a clean baseline for teams who want control.

### Key Takeaways

| Insight | Implication | Next Steps |
|---|---|---|
| CLI is the agent’s natural habitat | Lowest‑friction control loop | Standardize a CLI workflow |
| Provider lock‑in is a real tax | Open agents keep options open | Separate harness vs model |
| GitHub‑native flow accelerates shipping | Issues/PRs become part of the loop | Adopt Copilot CLI for repos |

### New Questions
- Which CLI agent becomes the **default shell** for teams?
- Do we need a *single* harness, or a **portfolio** of agents per task?
- What’s the right balance between **automation** and **approval gates**?
