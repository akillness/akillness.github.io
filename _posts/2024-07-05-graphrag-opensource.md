## Open Source RouteLLM Shows the Real Battle is in Query Routing. 

The GraphRAG project is a data pipeline and transformation suite that is designed to extract meaningful, structured data from unstructured text using the power of LLMs.

To learn more about GraphRAG and how it can be used to enhance your LLMs ability to reason about your private data, please visit the [Microsoft Research Blog Post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/).

## What is GraphRAG?

GraphRAG is an AI-based content interpretation and search capability. Using LLMs, it parses data to create a knowledge graph and answer user questions about a user-provided private dataset.

## What is RAG?

As Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the world with their impressive capabilities, a crucial limitation has become apparent - their knowledge remains static and limited to what they were trained on. In today's fast-paced world, this knowledge rapidly becomes outdated.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tackles two significant challenges associated with LLMs: keeping their knowledge up-to-date and providing accurate sources to support their responses.
