### RouteLLM ⇒ 𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝟱𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁 ✂️

*Curiosity:* What insights can we retrieve from this? How does this connect to innovation in the field?

*Curiosity:* The LMSys team maintains the ChatbotArena, which is a great evaluation system based on thousands of matches: when a user submits a query, they receive the answers from two hidden models A and B, and vote between the two. This preference data allows them to create an ELO ranking, which is a great indicator of model strength.



The team has found another great usage of this preference data they gathered: train a router to route user queries to the most appropriate model.

The main idea is that 𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙮 𝙦𝙪𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙙𝙤 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙧𝙚𝙦𝙪𝙞𝙧𝙚 𝙖 𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜 𝙢𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙡: for instance “summarize this paragraph in 1 sentence” can be solved very well by a small model like Llama-3-8B, which is orders of magnitude cheaper to run than the usual behemoths. If you manage to selectively route all easy queries to the smaller LLM, you can save a lot on the costs with minimal performance reduction (a queries will be poorly answered due to mis-routing)

So the team set on to train a router that given a query, chooses the most appropriate LLM to answer it, between a strong/expensive one and a weak/cheap one.

🛠️ Create a router between GPT-4 (strong model) and Mixtral-8x7B (small model)

🔢 Use preference data from 80k labels
- → Augment this with gold preference data for specific benchmarks
- → Define custom metrics to measure perf gain from routing
- → Test on MT-Bench, GSM8k, and MMLU

💥 Achieve 95% of GPT-4 quality on MT-Bench for over 2x cost reduction

✨ Overhead cost are minimal, even the most expensive routing method introduces an overhead under 0.4% of GPT-4 generation

🧂 Grain of salt: MT-Bench is really the benchmark where this method performs best, and introducing “gold data” from the benchmark probably biased results upwards. So the “95% perf for 2x cost reduction” will not be as impressive in a real setting
