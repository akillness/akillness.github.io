Not sure if you chunked your data right to enable optimal context retrieval?

Not sure which embedding model will work best for your data?

Donâ€™t worry, youâ€™re not alone..
 
## A RAG has several moving parts: data ingestion, retrieval, re-ranking, generation etc.. Each part comes with numerous options. 

If we consider a toy example, where you could choose from: 
- 5 different chunking methods,
- 5 different chunk sizes,
- 5 different embedding models,
- 5 different retrievers,
- 5 different re-rankers/ compressors
- 5 different prompts
- 5 different LLMs

ğŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s 78,125 distinct RAG configurations! 

If you could try evaluating each one in just 5 mins, thatâ€™d still take 271 days of non-stop trial-and-error effort! In short, itâ€™s kinda impossible to find your optimal RAG setup manually.

## So, how do you determine the most optimal RAG configuration for your data and use-case?

Use hyperparameter tuning - an ML technique for identifying the optimal values for your parameters when thereâ€™s a large set of possible values.

But, how do you do it without writing a bunch of code to do hyperparameter tuning?

I stumbled upon this tool â€˜RAGBuilderâ€™ that takes your data as an input, and runs hyperparameter tuning on the various RAG parameters (like chunk size, embedding etc.) evaluating multiple configs, and shows you a dashboard where you can see the top performing RAG setup, and in 1-click generate the code for that RAG setup. 

So you can go from your RAG use-case to production-grade RAG setup in just minutes.

Best part, itâ€™s open source with active contributors.
