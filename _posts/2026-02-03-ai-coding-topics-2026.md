## 🤔 Curiosity: When do agents stop being tools and start becoming a team?

Over the last few months, one question keeps coming back: **“Can AI coding act like a team, not just a helper?”**
In game production, a “team” is really a **pipeline**. If you want to ship at scale, you need **repeated loops, parallel work, and coordination**, not just a single assistant.

That’s why 2026’s trend isn’t just “better models.” It’s **better workflows**. Addy Osmani’s roundup makes that shift obvious.

## 📚 Retrieve: The core topics shaping AI coding in 2026

### 1) **Ralph Wiggum Pattern — persistent agent loops**
- **Closed‑loop execution** until a clear completion condition is met
- Strong for refactors, tests, codegen, repetitive tasks
- Weak for creative work or safety‑critical tasks

In game development, this feels like build automation: **great for repeatable pipelines, not for creative direction.**

### 2) **Agent Skills — modular expertise for agents**
- Packaged instructions/scripts/resources for precision work
- Evolving into an npm‑style ecosystem with install/update discipline

Just like game teams split roles, agents now split **specializations**.

### 3) **Multi‑agent orchestration**
- Shifts from “one conductor + one agent” to **parallel orchestration**
- Tools like Conductor, Vibe Kanban, Claude Code Web, GitHub Copilot Agent
- Common pattern: **Git worktrees + review/merge workflows**

In game production, this mirrors feature teams running **in parallel**, not sequentially.

### 4) **Beads & Gas Town — long‑term memory and organization**
- Beads: Git‑based durable reasoning trails
- Gas Town: organizational orcheschestration focused on throughput

This is close to **live‑ops structures** in games: optimize for output and continuity, not perfection.

### 5) **Local agents (OpenClaw) — power with risk**
- Local machine control (files, browser, terminal)
- High freedom means **security boundaries matter**

Think of it like local builds vs cloud builds: **balance power with safety**.

## 💡 Innovation: How this lands in game production pipelines

### My “agent team” sketch
- **Primary Orchestrator**: sprint planning + priorities
- **Feature Agent**: subsystem ownership (NPC AI, level generation)
- **Build/Test Agent**: CI automation, performance regression
- **Memory Agent**: Beads‑style decision log

With this structure, **iteration speed could explode**—especially for PCG, balance tuning, and automated testing.

### Key Takeaways

| Insight | Implication | Next Steps |
|---|---|---|
| Agents become teams | Parallel execution becomes default | Workflow design becomes a core skill |
| Skill ecosystems win | Expertise is modularized | Build a skill management strategy |
| Memory drives scale | Knowledge must persist in systems | Adopt Beads‑style logs |

### New Questions
- How will multi‑agent workflows **change game team structures**?
- Where should we draw the line for agent loops in **QA and balance**?
- Can we keep local agent power **without compromising safety**?
