## Want to land that dream cloud job? 

Stop building To-do apps. The best way to get practical hands-on experience with AWS is to build a 3-tier application. 

When building this architecture, you'll learn how to configure:

- 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸: VPC, Subnets, Route tables
- 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: Security groups, NACLs
- 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: EC2/Fargate, Auto Scaling
- 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 & 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲: S3, Amazon Aurora
