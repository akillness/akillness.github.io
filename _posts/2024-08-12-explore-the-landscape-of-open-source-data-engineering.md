### 1. Storage Systems: 
- From relational OLTP databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL to distributed SQL DBMS like CockroachDB and TiDB, find the right storage solution for your needs
- Includes NoSQL options like MongoDB and Redis for diverse data requirements.

### 2. Data Integration: 
- Tools for CDC, log and event collection, and data integration platforms such as Kafka Connect, CloudQuery, and Airbyte ensure seamless data flow and event management.

### 3. Data Infrastructure & Monitoring: 
- Manage and monitor your data infrastructure with tools for resource scheduling like Kubernetes and Docker, security solutions like Apache Knox, and observability frameworks like Prometheus and ELK.

### 4. Data Processing & Computation: 
-  Optimize your data processing with unified processing platforms like Apache Beam and Spark, batch processing with Hadoop, and stream processing with Flink and Samza.

### 5. ML/AI Platform: 
-  Empower your machine learning and AI initiatives with vector storage solutions like Milvus, MLOps platforms like MLflow and Kubeflow, and other AI tools for enhanced data insights.

### 6. Data Lake Platform: 
-  Efficiently manage large-scale data with distributed file systems like Hadoop HDFS, open table formats like Iceberg, and serialization frameworks like Parquet.

### 7. Workflow & Data Ops: 
-  Streamline your data operations with workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow, data quality solutions like Great Expectations, and data warehousing with LakeFS.

### 8. Metadata Management: 
-  Organize and manage your metadata with platforms like Amundsen and Apache Atlas, and ensure data security with tools like Hive and Schema-registry.

### 9. Analytics & Visualization: 
- Enhance your data analysis and visualization with BI tools like Superset, query and collaboration tools like Hue, and semantic layers like Cube, AtScale, etc.
