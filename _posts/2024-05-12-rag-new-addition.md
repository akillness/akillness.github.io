## ðŸŽŠ My RAG papers list has now been updated with the newest additions, including those from April. It contains over 60 papers, with quick summaries and topic tags.


ðŸ”‰ Over the past year, the release of new LLMs and their increasing application across various fields has also spurred a surge in research on RAG approaches. A ton of advanced methods have been proposed to boost RAG's efficiency in step with the wider adoption of LLMs. 

ðŸ’¡ I have compiled a selection of the most popular papers on RAG starting from April 2023 to the present, categorized as follows:

### â›³ RAG Survey
ðŸ“– Comprehensive overview of existing methods in RAG.

### â›³ RAG Enhancement (Advanced Techniques)
ðŸ“– Proposals for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the RAG pipeline.

### â›³ Retrieval Improvement
ðŸ“– Techniques focused on enhancing the retrieval component of RAG.

### â›³ Comparison Papers
ðŸ“– Papers comparing RAG with other methods or approaches.

### â›³ Domain-Specific RAG
ðŸ“–Adaptation of RAG techniques for specific domains or applications.

### â›³RAG Evaluation: 
ðŸ“–Assessment of the performance and effectiveness of RAG models.

### â›³RAG Embeddings: 
ðŸ“–Methods for developing better embedding techniques optimized for RAG or retrieval in RAG.

### â›³Input Processing for RAG:
ðŸ“–Techniques for preprocessing input data to optimize the performance and effectiveness of RAG models.

Depending on the use-case, you can explore relevant papers to address various challenges and improve RAG. Happy Learning!
