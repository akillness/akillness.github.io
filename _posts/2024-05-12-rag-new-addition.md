## 🎊 My RAG papers list has now been updated with the newest additions, including those from April. It contains over 60 papers, with quick summaries and topic tags.


🔉 Over the past year, the release of new LLMs and their increasing application across various fields has also spurred a surge in research on RAG approaches. A ton of advanced methods have been proposed to boost RAG's efficiency in step with the wider adoption of LLMs. 

💡 I have compiled a selection of the most popular papers on RAG starting from April 2023 to the present, categorized as follows:

### ⛳ RAG Survey
📖 Comprehensive overview of existing methods in RAG.

### ⛳ RAG Enhancement (Advanced Techniques)
📖 Proposals for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the RAG pipeline.

### ⛳ Retrieval Improvement
📖 Techniques focused on enhancing the retrieval component of RAG.

### ⛳ Comparison Papers
📖 Papers comparing RAG with other methods or approaches.

### ⛳ Domain-Specific RAG
📖Adaptation of RAG techniques for specific domains or applications.

### ⛳RAG Evaluation: 
📖Assessment of the performance and effectiveness of RAG models.

### ⛳RAG Embeddings: 
📖Methods for developing better embedding techniques optimized for RAG or retrieval in RAG.

### ⛳Input Processing for RAG:
📖Techniques for preprocessing input data to optimize the performance and effectiveness of RAG models.

Depending on the use-case, you can explore relevant papers to address various challenges and improve RAG. Happy Learning!
