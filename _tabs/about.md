### Curiosity → Retrieve → Innovation

I don't just research AI—I ship it. But more importantly, I'm driven by questions that haven't been asked yet.

My playground sits at the intersection of games, AI/ML/CV/NLP, and interactive systems. I've spent eight years asking "what if?" and then digging deep to retrieve the answers—whether they're buried in research papers, hidden in production data, or waiting to be discovered through experimentation. From reinforcement learning agents (DQN, MCTS) to automated QA systems using computer vision, I build fast, iterate faster, and deliver results that move products forward.

**The cycle I live by:**  
Curiosity sparks the question → Retrieve knowledge from research, data, and experiments → Innovation emerges from connecting the dots.

### What I Do

**→ Retrieve insights from the intersection of research and production**  
I dig into papers, experiment with cutting-edge techniques, and extract what actually works at scale. Building game AI agents, PCG tools, and digital human pipelines that ship to millions of players isn't just about implementation—it's about retrieving the right knowledge at the right time.

**→ Convert curiosity into innovation**  
Every "I wonder if..." becomes a hypothesis. Every experiment becomes a story. Every prototype becomes a product. I'm constantly asking: _What can we learn from this? How can we push this further?_

**→ Patent-backed innovations in game difficulty and emotional computing**  
Research that matters. Technology that scales. Innovation that starts with a curious question and ends with something that didn't exist before.

### How I Work

**→ Curiosity-driven exploration**  
I start with questions, not assumptions. "What if we tried this?" "Why does this work?" "How can we make this better?" The best innovations come from being genuinely curious about the problem space.

**→ Retrieve knowledge systematically**  
I don't just read papers—I extract patterns. I don't just run experiments—I retrieve insights. I don't just build prototypes—I uncover what's possible. Knowledge retrieval is an active process of synthesis and application.

**→ Fast execution with iterative innovation**  
The best way to validate curiosity is to build it, test it, and learn from real results. But innovation doesn't stop at the first prototype—it's about retrieving feedback, asking new questions, and pushing boundaries further.

**→ Clear communication of complex discoveries**  
Complex systems deserve clear explanations. I turn technical depth into actionable insights, making sure the innovations we retrieve can be understood and built upon.

### Current Work

**Research Focus**  
I'm curious about the future of infinite game content creation. What happens when generative AI meets game design? How can we retrieve meaningful patterns from player behavior to create truly adaptive experiences? I'm building the bridge between cutting-edge AI research and production-ready game systems—one curious question at a time.
