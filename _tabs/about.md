## Let me introduce myself.

~~~
Hello, my master's degree studies are on user behavior analysis in gaming-specific cameras, emotions and keyboards.
 And for emotions, we used MLP-based emotional computing. ( Called "Emotion Tracer" )

I have experience creating an MCTS-based play agent for a match-3 puzzle game to predict level balancing.
(Previously, I trained reinforcement learning-based play agents in a Dungeon Delivery game environment.)
Next, we had the experience of creating a leveled map generator for a match-3 puzzle game with Playing Agent. ( Called "MAFIA" )

Recently, I have been joining to create face model from 4D scans to deep learning models. (From Called "AVATAR" )

Because we want to reduce the cost of creating high-quality facial animations like a digital double.

Now, I want to learn more powerful technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, generative AI for games.
As soon as possible, i want to create a game with infinite content using generative AI.

I am growing as a programming engineer in the game industry.

If you have the same idea, always please contact me :D  👉 <https://www.linkedin.com/in/akillness38/>
