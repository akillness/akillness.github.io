## Let me introduce myself !

~~~
Hello, my master's degree studies are on user behavior analysis in gaming-specific cameras, emotions and keyboards.
 And for emotions, we used MLP-based emotional computing. ( Called "Emotion Tracer" )

I have experience creating an MCTS-based play agent for a match-3 puzzle game to predict level balancing.
(Previously, I trained reinforcement learning-based play agents in a Dungeon Delivery game environment.)
Next, we had the experience of creating a leveled map generator for a match-3 puzzle game with Playing Agent.

Recently, I have been trying to create face model from 4D scans to deep learning models. 

Because we want to reduce the cost of creating facial animations for too many characters. ( Called "AVATAR" )

I want to learn more powerful technologies such as machine learning/deep learning/generative AI for games.
As soon as possible, i want to create a game with infinite content using generative AI.

I am growing as a programming engineer in the game industry.

If you have the same idea, always please contact me :D
